Senior Year Projects 2022-2023

Hi, I'm Katheirne Panora.
I'm interested in programming and prototyping websites.
I'm currently learning on how to master jQuery, and just starting off on GitHub. 
I'm looking to collaborate on future events that're up-and-coming!
I can be reached through email @katherinep90@nycstudents.net
