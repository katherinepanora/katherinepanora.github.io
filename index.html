      Over the weekend, I mainly rested as the entire week was hectic. Sunday was special because it was my sister's dance performance at the Melrose Ballroom, with Lorenz Latin Dance Studio class. She had been practicing for months and seeing her on stage rather than her practicing at home was way better and prettier.
